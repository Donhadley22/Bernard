                The supreme irony of life is that hardly anyone gets out of it alive. 
                A tragic irony of life is that we so often achieve success or financial independence after the 
                chief reason for which we sought it has passed away. 
                It's an irony of life saying, 'sometimes, good things happen in goodbyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life is hard and tough but life can’t taste good without its irony.

        <h3>Kinds of People</h3>
                <p>There are two kinds of people in this world, 
                those who long to be understood and those who long to be misunderstood. 
                It is the irony of life that neither is gratified.</p>
